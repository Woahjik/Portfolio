# Portfolio

Hey there! My name is Alex and this is my software portfolio. Below are a few projects that I've worked on in my spare time.

## Wordle

This is a Wordle clone I made using C#. A random five letter word is selected from a long text file. The user gets 6 attempts to guess the word. If a letter in the guess is containted in the answer, that letter is marked with a question mark. If a letter in the guess is in the same position as the answer, that letter is marked with an exclaimation point.

## Game Console

This project is a fun text-based game console application. I created this project with C#. It allows user accounts to be created, stored in a text file, and logged into. After a user account is logged in, there are 5 different games to play.
